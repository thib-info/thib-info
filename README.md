- 👋 Hi everyone, I'm @thib-info / @lodrilus / Buze Thibault. I'm an engineering student in computer Science at ENSISA (Mulhouse France).

- 👀 I’m interested in all the new technologies but above all, how to crack them !
       **CyberSec** is one of my biggest passion since now **7 years**. Between CTF, private labs and vulnerable machines I've founded a huge playground where I can practice whenever I want !
       Volley-Ball is one of my other passion (I'm practicing as professional since 1 year now) so I want to specify it here in GitHub even if this place is not really a sport community 😅
     
- 🌱 I’m currently learning too many things to explain them. I think, like every computer engineer, that we learn new things all days, and it's why we love what we do.
        "Never stop to learn, because knowledge never stops".

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every interesting projects which need to learn/discover something new.
        But if you're passionate about CyberSec too, you can reach me to see if we can collaborate on anything (Project of dev, CTF team ...)
